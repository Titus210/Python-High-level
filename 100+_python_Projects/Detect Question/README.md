## DETECT QUESTION
Detecting questions means identifying whether a sentence is interrogative or not.<br/>
 We can also use machine learning to detect questions, but since we all know the type of sentences we see in an interrogative sentence, it is also possible to write a Python script to detect whether a sentence is a question or not.
