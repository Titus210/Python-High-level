## Grouping anagrams
Anagram is arranging letters from words by using each letter once <br/>
example: <br/>
```     
    words = [cat, ate, drink,eat]
    arranged = [cat, [ate,eat] drink]
```
### Ways to solve anagrams
1. __Brute force approach__: <br/>
- This is to iterate over list of words
- Search for anagram of each word
- Maintain the list to avoid duplicates
2. __Sorting algorithm__: <br/>
This is sorting strings in specific order, anagrams will have same order of words, specify if the strings ara anagram or not <br/>

### Code implementation
The code is implemented in the two different ways
