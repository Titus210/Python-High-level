## 		Introduction
Python is simple, general purpose, high-level and object-oriented language, developed by  Guido van Rossum.
###	Features 
- Easy to learn.
- Object oriented programming.
- Integrated
- Has dynamic memory allocation.
- Extensible
- Inteprated language.
- GUI Programming.
- Embeddale: It can be implemented in other languages i.e `C` and `C++`.
###	Application of python
- Web development:
	There are several frameworks such as django, flask, Pyramid, CherryPy That supports server side web development.
- Data Science:
	Python is widely used in data science using pandas, tableu, matplotlib for data science and visualization.
- Machine Learning:
	Tensorflow, pyTorch Scikit-learn, matplotlib, Scipy etc. helps to implement machine leaning.
- Mathematics:
	Using Numpy, Pandas are usefull in mathematics operations.
- Data mining
- Console applications.
- Mobile applications.
- Speech recognition.
- Software development.
- Enterprice aplication.
- Computer vision and image processing.
- 3D CAD applications.

## installation
Python is mostly initially installed in most operationg systems:<br/>
`python3 --version`  to check if its installed.

### vim and python
To install python on linux system type:
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get python3`

> Shebang line:
Add `#!/usr/bin/python3` on your first python file
```
	#!usr/bin/python/python3
	print("Hello world")
```
Thats all you need to install python and type your first code in python.

***
## 		Basics
####  variables and comments
```
 #!/usr/bin/python3
	x = 10
	print(x)    # This is a comment
```
####  identifiers
Identifiers are user-defined keywords <br/>
- Class names start with capital  letters all other identifiers start with lowercase.
- Identifier starting with single underscore indictes its private.
- Two starting underscore indicates its strongly private.
- Ending with two underscore its a special language defined name.
####	Coments
```
	#This is a single line comment
	'''
	This is a multiline comment
	'''
```
####	Multistatement
We use line character to for multi lines

```
	print("When starting to program i found it difficult but concistency \
		and never giving up keeps me going on on this journey")
```

####	Quotation

```
	word = 'Hello'
	sentence = " Hello world"
	paragraph = '''Hello world  \
			This  is a multiline comment
		     '''
```
